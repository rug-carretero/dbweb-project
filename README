README

This website provides a platform for people who want to make use of the crowd sourcing method - project owners - and participants in crowd sourcing projects.
	Project owners are able to set up multiple projects. Each project has its own set of questions. These questions can be either an open question or a multiple choice question. Furthermore 
the project owner is able to set criteria for his or her projects. For example a project can only be available for people in a certain country or based on certain interests.
	Participants can as well as project owners participate in project(s) of their choice. They are freely to choose to participate in the project available for them and then answer the 
questions related to those projects.

INSTALLATION
